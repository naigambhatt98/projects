    <h2>Why I Chose This Project</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always been drawn to practical applications of AI. When given the chance to create something that blended utility with creativity, I wanted to focus on a problem people face every day. Personal finance felt like the right space to explore. Financial literacy and planning are challenges many deal with, so I designed an assistant to help make those decisions easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal was to use generative AI not just for rapid prototyping but to guide thoughtful experience design. Canva’s generative site builder enabled me to iterate quickly and shape ideas into a working user flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Visuals & Process</h2>
    <p>
      I used <strong>Canva’s generative AI features</strong> to design an interactive prototype of a personal financial assistant. Rather than starting with raw code, I mapped out the user journey visually, integrating tools like a Budget Planner, Savings Tracker, and Investment Advisor through clickable elements and form-based pages. You can explore it here:

    </p>
    <p>
      Using generative tools made it easy to tweak, revise, and polish the assistant in real time—helping me focus on logic, usability, and design consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Thinking and Generative AI</h2>
    <p>
      This wasn’t about building another webpage—it was about building trust. I asked myself: What would someone need from an assistant when they're overwhelmed with finances? The answers: clarity, simplicity, and a sense of control.
    </p>
    <p>
      With AI-assisted tools, I could iterate rapidly. I crafted each module as a friendly guide, making sure the tone felt helpful, not robotic. The assistant’s layout reflects this philosophy: clear categories, modular features, and just enough input to reduce friction.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Generative AI let me focus on <strong>intent</strong> over interface. I could act as both a designer and a decision-maker."
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
      This experience showed me that the best AI tools don’t replace thought—they accelerate it. Canva’s generative interface reduced busywork and freed up mental space for UX thinking. Even without programming, I could design logic, test structure, and create something functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also learned the value of modular design. Each assistant tool—budgeting, saving, investing—was treated as its own component, which made the process clearer and the output cleaner.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Create Something Like This</h2>
    <p>
      If you're curious about how to use Canva’s AI tools to build similar experiences, here's a helpful tutorial article from Canva's official learn platform:

    </p>
    

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      My financial assistant prototype is just one example of what can happen when thoughtful design meets the power of generative AI. It's not just about automation—it's about amplifying creativity and clarity. If this kind of tool can help someone feel less anxious about money, then it’s done its job.
