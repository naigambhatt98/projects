    <h2>Why I Chose This Project</h2>
    <p>I’ve always been drawn to practical applications of AI. When given the chance to create something that blended utility with creativity, I focused on a problem people face every day. Personal finance felt like the right space to explore.</p>
    <p>My goal was to use generative AI not just for rapid prototyping but to guide thoughtful experience design. Canva’s site builder enabled quick iterations and helped shape a user-focused flow.</p>

    <h2>Visuals & Process</h2>

    <p>Using <strong>Canva’s generative AI features</strong>, I created an interactive prototype for a personal financial assistant. Rather than starting with raw code, I mapped the user journey visually. <a href="https://historyofartificailintelligence.my.canva.site/financial-assistant-concept-with-clickable-options" target="_blank">Explore the assistant site</a>.</p>

    <h2>Design Thinking and Generative AI</h2>
    <p>This wasn’t about building another webpage—it was about building trust. What does someone need when overwhelmed with finances? Clarity, simplicity, and a sense of control. With AI-assisted tools, I rapidly prototyped friendly and supportive user flows.</p>
    <blockquote>"Generative AI let me focus on <strong>intent</strong> over interface. I could act as both a designer and a decision-maker."</blockquote>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>This project reinforced that the best AI tools don’t replace thought—they accelerate it. Canva reduced busywork and created space for real UX thinking. I also came to value modular design—each tool (budgeting, saving, investing) became a clean component in the system.</p>

    <h2>How to Build One Yourself</h2>
    <p>If you’d like to explore Canva’s AI tools, here’s a helpful resource: <a href="https://www.canva.com/ai-assistant/" target="_blank">Canva AI Assistant Overview</a>.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This prototype is a small glimpse into what’s possible when thoughtful design meets AI. If it helps reduce someone’s anxiety around money, it has done its job.</p>
